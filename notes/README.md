# What are this????

Since there were no objections, I have added my class notes to the
repo! I got a fancy pen that records synced audio with my handwritten
notes (and digitizes them), and it has been a significant boon to my
studying, so I figured I'd share it with the whole class.

# Sounds good, how do I view them?

It's pretty plug-'n-play. You should be able to just download any of
the .pdf files, go to the
[website](http://www.livescribe.com/int/pdf/player/lsnotesdesktop.htm)
linked in the file, and drag the .pdf into the box there. At that
point, you should get to a thingy that lets you play the audio + watch
my notes appear as they were written (nifty!)

The greyed-out text is stuff I'm going to write, and the green marks
stuff I've already written. If you click on any of the writing, it
should take you to that point in the audio. You can also listen at 2x
speed, etc.

# The website is yelling at me for not having the right kind of pdf...

This probably means that you accidentally saved over the pdf after
downloading it. Livescribe is pretty picky about the .pdf files you
put into their website --- apparently the magic they work behind the
scenes to get the audio to sync gets deleteted when you save over the
.pdf with most standard viewers (e.g., preview, adobe reader, etc).

Try redownloading the .pdf files and then trying again. If problem
persists, please notify me by
